            Okay so if you are reading this, it means that we are the 19th of December 2023. At this exact date we can proudly say that we
            made it to 2 years and 2 months together. Honestly i couldn't even realise how time went by , and how much memories we succeded to create
            together throughout these two awesome years. So much love, so many hugs and kisses, long talks and conversations, and i still can't describe
            how many great things we succesfully created together. I'm really glad to say that we are starting a new year together, a new chapter to ourlives, 
            2024, i already can't wait to live new experiences together and to create awesome memories just like we did throughout this past year and it was and felt
            just amazing. Thank you for these wonderful 2 years and 2 months spent together my love, i will never be able to express how much i really love you
            it is beyond everything. I love you my soulmate, my soul, my very essence, and I adore you beyond measure. &#128151;
