    <h1>My Dearest,</h1>
    <p>
      Here we are, the first day of the month, not any month tho, it's june, and exactly 19 years ago was born one of the most, if not the most incredible girl known to this day : Maroumti!!
      Today is your day, it's the day that will remind everybody how lucky we are to have you in our lives (especially My life ;) ). I want this day to remind you how much you bring to your close ones, love, beuty, kindness, understanding, laughter, hapiness, sincerness ... and many many more things i personally want to thank you about.     
    </p>

      Everyday, you keep groing as a person, you keep pushing yourself to what's better, and this year made me realize how much we can achieve together. 12 months passed, and each and every day of them , kept making me get to know you the slightest bit better, even if i already knew a lot of things about you, i'm still willing to continue this wonderful learning process, that is not only getting us closer, but also making me build a better version of myself everyday.

      In this letter i want to thank you for being the amazing woman i was lucky enough to meet and get closer to. I've never been this grateful in my life, being almost two years together now is one of the best things that happened to me as a man. You light up my world with your beautiful smile, eyes, face, body, mind, spirit and personnality. I am a really lucky man, and you always  know how to remind me that.
    </p>

      Darling, I want you to know that my love for you knows no bounds. You are the one who completes me, who makes me whole. With you, I have found a love that surpasses all expectations and fills my heart with an indescribable joy. Happy birthday my love â™¥
